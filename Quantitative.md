## Time Value of Money
### Interest 
* Time Value of Money
   * Money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its **potential earning capacity**
   * Cash Flow additivity principle  
        Can only be added on if thery are indexed at the **same point of time**
   * Concers **Equivalence relationships** between *cash flows* occuring on *different dates*
* Interest Rate
  * 3 applications
    * Required Rate of Return  (From the risk perspectivce)
        Minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order to accepct the investment
    * Discounted Rate  
        We discount the future amounts to find the value today
    * Opportunity cost  (From the loss choosing others, not this one'sperspective)
        The value forgo by choosing a particular course of action
  * Components
    * RF Risk-free Rate (almost exists only in theory, value is small)
    * Risk premium (风险溢价)
      * Default risk premium
      * Liquidity premium (Intution: 要买买不到, 要卖卖不掉)
      * Maturity premium (From the time perspective, e.g. cannot ensure that the investors exist in 5 years)
      * ... 
    * Nominal IR = Nominal RFIR + Risk Premium
    * Nominal RFIR $\approx$ Real RF interest rate + Inflation Rate / Premium
    * Notes: In CFA exams
      * If talking about *Real IR*, then it must includes *Real*. Otherwise, it is nominal
      * If saying that the "T-bills; US Treasury Bill; U.S. Treasury securities; Treasury bills" (美国国库券)
        Then it is *Nominal RFIR*  
      * If saying that T-bills has short/middle/long term, then in Quantitative: use **short term IR** as the RFIR 
### Effective Annual 
* Simple / Compounding IR
  * Simple  
    $Principal \times (1 + IR \times n)$
  * Compounding  
    $Principal \times (1 + IR)^n$
* Effective annual IR  
  * Simple  
    same as above
  * Discrete Compounding  
    EAR = ($1 + \frac{I/Y}{n}$)$^n - 1$
  * Continuous Compounding  (Infinite times)
    EAR = $e^{r_s} - 1$  
    1. $lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty}(1 + \frac{1}{n})^n = e$
    2. $lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty}(1 + \frac{I/Y}{n})^{\frac{n}{I/Y} \times I/Y}= e^{I/Y}$
  * Compounding frequency $n$ 
  * Periodic IR ($\frac{I/Y}{n}$)
